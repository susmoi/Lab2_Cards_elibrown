# What is the War Game?
The game of war is played by creating two deck objects. One for each of the two players. Then both of the decks are shuffled.

Next each player selects a card object. The two cards are ranked against one another, with the highest ranking card "winning" the round.

After all of the 52 cards are played, the player with the most points wins the game!
